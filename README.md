# MailMetrics
**A privacy-first solution to gain insights from your email without compromising your data.**

MailMetrics was born from a desire to clean up a cluttered inbox and a fascination with the complexities of authentication concepts like OAuth and OIDC. Keeping your data safe is paramount; this desktop application is designed to be self-hosted, ensuring your email information never touches our servers.  The vision is to create a user-friendly tool that empowers individuals to understand their email habits while firmly prioritizing privacy. 


## Intention

I intend to build MailMetrics as a self-hosted, open-source desktop application. This approach guarantees privacy â€“ your email data remains entirely under your control. My goal is to create a community-driven project that helps everyone gain valuable insights from their inbox without compromising their data.
